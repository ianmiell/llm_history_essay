QUESTION: what is collini's view on the hobhouse's relationship to new liberalism

ANSWER:

In *Liberalism and Sociology*, Stefan Collini discusses L.T. Hobhouse's significant contributions to both New Liberalism and sociology, positioning him as a central figure who bridged these two intellectual movements. Collini argues that Hobhouse did not see sociology and New Liberalism as opposed or separate fields but rather as complementary. Hobhouse viewed sociology as a crucial tool for understanding the social conditions necessary for the success of liberal reforms, particularly those tied to the New Liberalism of the early 20th century.

Collini highlights that Hobhouse’s political theory grew out of earlier liberal traditions, but he adapted it to the new social realities and pressures of the Edwardian period, where social reform was increasingly seen as a necessity. Hobhouse’s sociology was deeply entwined with his political commitments, especially in the sense that he believed liberal reforms had to be based on an understanding of social dynamics. He opposed laissez-faire individualism and argued that a stronger role for the state, informed by sociological insights, was crucial for achieving social progress. This ties closely to New Liberalism's advocacy for state intervention to address social inequalities, a marked shift from the older classical liberal emphasis on minimal state interference.

Collini's interpretation is that Hobhouse's work reflects a synthesis of sociological thinking and New Liberal political ideals, where sociology provided the scientific foundation for reformist policies. Hobhouse's view of the state and society was more complex than the simple dichotomy of individualism versus collectivism. He believed that individual freedom could only be realized through the social cooperation and state structures that ensured equality and justice. Therefore, in Collini's view, Hobhouse’s sociology and his New Liberalism were two sides of the same coin, mutually reinforcing rather than conflicting.

This reading suggests that Collini sees Hobhouse as an intellectual who managed to blend liberal political philosophy with sociological analysis, thereby contributing to the theoretical underpinnings of New Liberalism, particularly its focus on social welfare and state responsibility【11†source】.

QUESTION: Can you give specific quotes from Collini to back up these arguments?

ANSWER:

Stefan Collini provides an in-depth analysis of Hobhouse’s connection to New Liberalism in *Liberalism and Sociology*. Collini discusses how Hobhouse's thought aligned with New Liberal ideas, especially regarding the relationship between liberty and state intervention. He emphasizes that Hobhouse sought to reconcile traditional liberal principles with the need for state involvement in ensuring social welfare. Collini notes that for Hobhouse, the contradictions within individualism exposed the necessity of a more collective approach, yet Hobhouse framed this as an extension of liberal tradition rather than a departure from it.

One key passage highlights Hobhouse’s move toward New Liberalism: "He now drew attention to the way in which the contradictions within Individualism arose out of an implicit recognition of the role of the state in furthering the welfare of its citizens"【18:1†source】. Collini also describes Hobhouse’s belief that New Liberalism was not a complete rejection of classical liberalism but rather an evolution: "He increasingly favoured the ‘New Liberalism’ as the appropriate label for the cause he was advocating"【18:1†source】.

Collini points out that while Hobhouse accepted some aspects of collectivism, he still saw himself as operating within a liberal framework, extending traditional liberal arguments to address the social challenges of the time. This view underscores Hobhouse's attempt to legitimize social reform policies by invoking established liberal figures like Mill and Green to defend progressive social policies【18:1†source】【18:7†source】.

These quotes provide a clear basis for understanding how Collini views Hobhouse's relationship to New Liberalism as one of adaptation and synthesis, rather than radical break, with earlier liberal ideas.
