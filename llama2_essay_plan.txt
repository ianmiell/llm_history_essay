>>> how different was old liberalism from new liberalism

Old liberalism and new liberalism are two distinct political ideologies that have evolved over time, with some key differences.

1. Economic views: Old liberalism emphasized the importance of economic freedom and believed in laissez-faire capitalism, where the government's role was limited
to protecting property rights and maintaining public order. In contrast, new liberalism advocates for a more active role for government in regulating the economy
and addressing issues such as income inequality and environmental degradation.
2. Social views: Old liberalism tended to focus on individual rights and freedoms, with a belief that society would naturally become more equal and just as long
as individuals were free to pursue their own interests. New liberalism places greater emphasis on social justice and equality, recognizing that individual
freedom is not always enough to ensure that everyone has an equal chance to succeed.
3. Role of government: Old liberals saw government intervention in the economy as a threat to individual liberty and believed that the state should only provide
public goods that cannot be effectively provided by the private sector. New liberals, on the other hand, believe that the government has a responsibility to play
an active role in addressing social and economic problems, such as poverty, discrimination, and access to healthcare.
4. Attitudes towards markets: Old liberalism had faith in the ability of markets to allocate resources efficiently and believed that government intervention
would often do more harm than good. New liberalism recognizes that markets can fail and that government intervention may be necessary to correct these failures
and promote social welfare.
5. International relations: Old liberalism tended to focus on the idea of state sovereignty and non-intervention in international affairs. New liberals, however,
believe that global problems require global solutions and support greater international cooperation and the establishment of international institutions to
address issues such as climate change, human rights, and economic development.
6. Social justice: Old liberalism tended to focus on individual rights and freedoms, while new liberalism places a greater emphasis on social justice and
equality. New liberals recognize that individual freedom is not always enough to ensure that everyone has an equal chance to succeed and believe that government
policies should actively promote social justice and address issues such as discrimination and inequality.
7. Environmental policy: Old liberalism tended to neglect environmental concerns, while new liberalism places a greater emphasis on protecting the environment
and addressing climate change. New liberals recognize that environmental degradation can have severe consequences for human well-being and support government
policies to promote sustainable development and reduce carbon emissions.
8. Economic justice: Old liberalism tended to focus on economic growth and believed that it would naturally benefit all members of society. New liberals,
however, recognize that economic growth can often come at the expense of certain groups, such as workers or the environment, and support policies that promote
greater economic justice, such as progressive taxation, labor rights, and social welfare programs.
9. Human rights: Old liberalism tended to focus on individual rights and freedoms, while new liberalism places a greater emphasis on human rights and social
justice. New liberals recognize that individual freedom is not always enough to ensure that everyone has an equal chance to succeed and support government
policies that promote human rights and address issues such as discrimination and inequality.
10. Role of civil society: Old liberalism tended to neglect the role of civil society in promoting social justice and human rights. New liberals, however,
recognize the importance of civil society organizations in advancing social justice and human rights and support government policies that promote their work and
impact.

In summary, while old liberalism and new liberalism share some similarities, they have distinct approaches to issues such as economic regulation, social justice,
environmental policy, and international relations. New liberalism places a greater emphasis on promoting social justice, addressing market failures, and
supporting international cooperation, while old liberalism tends to focus more on individual freedom and limited government intervention.
