Final Answer:
Liberalism in the Victorian era was a complex and evolving concept, influenced by various political, economic, and social factors. In order to fully understand its development, it is important to consider multiple perspectives and sources, including the arguments put forth by Stefan Collini in his book "Liberalism and Sociology: L.T. Hobhouse and Political Argument in England, 1880-1914."

Collini argues that the traditional view of liberalism as a purely individualistic and laissez-faire ideology is incomplete. He suggests that a new form of liberalism emerged in the late Victorian era, which emphasized the role of the state in promoting social welfare and addressing economic inequality. This new liberalism, also known as social liberalism, was influenced by the ideas of thinkers such as L.T. Hobhouse and John Stuart Mill.

To further explore this argument, it is important to examine the historical context of the Victorian era. The period between 1820 and 1914 was marked by significant social and economic changes, including the Industrial Revolution and the rise of capitalism. These changes led to growing concerns about social inequality and the role of the state in addressing it.

Victorian era, in British history, the period between approximately 1820 and 1914, corresponding roughly but not exactly to the period of Queen Victoria 's reign (1837-1901) and characterized by a class-based society, a growing number of people able to vote, a growing state and economy, and Britain's status as the most powerful empire in the world. The British Industrial Revolution (1760-1840) witnessed a great number of technical innovations, such as steam-powered machines, which resulted in new working practices, which in turn brought many social changes. More women and children worked than ever before, for the first time more people lived in towns and cities than in the countryside ... The cost of food and consumer goods was reduced as items were mass-produced and transportation costs decreased. Better tools became available for manufacturers and farmers. The coal, iron, and steel industries boomed to provide fuel and raw materials for machines to work. The canal system was expanded but then declined. The Industrial Revolution during this age transformed the agrarian economy of England into an industrial economy. Mills and factories were established at important centers, and the whole of England hummed with the rattle of looms and booms of weaving machines.

Final Answer: The key economic changes that occurred during the Victorian era were the British Industrial Revolution, which brought about technical innovations and new working practices, the expansion of the coal, iron, and steel industries, and the establishment of mills and factories. These changes transformed the agrarian economy of England into an industrial one, leading to a booming economy and a decrease in the cost of food and consumer goods. However, these changes also brought about social unrest and economic distress among the masses, as more women and children were forced to work and the gap between the rich and poor widened. These economic changes had a significant impact on the development of liberalism, as they led to a growing class-based society, a larger number of people with the right to vote, and a more powerful British empire.
