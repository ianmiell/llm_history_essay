This shift was influenced by various historical events and key figures, and it is important to understand the significance of these factors in order to fully comprehend the differences between old and new liberalism.

In his book, "The Idea of History in Victorian Britain", Collini argues that the Victorian era saw a shift from the traditional liberal values of individualism and laissez-faire to a more collectivist and interventionist approach. This new form of liberalism, known as new liberalism, was a response to the changing social and economic conditions of the time.

One of the major events that influenced the development of new liberalism was the Industrial Revolution. This period of rapid industrialization and urbanization brought about significant changes in society, leading to the rise of social problems such as poverty, inequality, and poor working conditions. This prompted liberal thinkers to question the traditional liberal values and advocate for a more active role of the state in addressing these issues.
