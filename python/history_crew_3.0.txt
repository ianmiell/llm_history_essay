Final Answer:
After conducting a thorough research into the question of liberalism in the Victorian era and beyond, it is clear that the development of old liberalism to new liberalism was a complex and multifaceted process. In order to fully understand this evolution, it is important to identify key historical resources and pay particular attention to Stefan Collini's arguments.

One of the key resources in understanding liberalism in the Victorian era is the period itself. The Victorian era, which lasted from 1820 to 1914, was a time of significant political, social, and economic change. It was during this period that formal national politics in Britain was dominated by two major parties, the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. This political landscape set the stage for the development of liberalism and its various forms.

One of the most influential figures in the development of liberalism during this period was John Stuart Mill. Mill, an English philosopher, political economist, politician, and civil servant, is considered one of the most influential thinkers in the history of classical liberalism. His contributions to social theory, political theory, and political economy have had a lasting impact on the development of liberalism.

Another important resource in understanding liberalism in the Victorian era is the book "Victorian Liberalism" published in 1990. This book[0m

Final Answer: After researching primary sources from the Victorian era, it is clear that old liberalism and new liberalism were two distinct ideologies that emerged during the 19th century. Old liberalism, also known as classical liberalism, emphasized individual rights, limited government intervention, and free market capitalism. New liberalism, on the other hand, focused on social reform, government intervention to address social issues, and a more regulated economy. These ideologies were shaped by the changing social and economic conditions of the Victorian era, and their impact can still be seen in modern political debates.[0m
