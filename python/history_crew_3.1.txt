Final Answer:
Liberalism in the Victorian era was a complex and evolving concept, with various interpretations and applications. The period between 1820 and 1914, known as the Victorian era, saw the dominance of two major political parties - the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. However, it was during this time that the concept of liberalism underwent significant changes, leading to the emergence of new liberalism.

One of the key figures in the development of new liberalism was John Stuart Mill, an English philosopher, political economist, and civil servant. Mill's contributions to social theory, political theory, and political economy were highly influential and he is often referred to as the most influential English-speaking philosopher of the nineteenth century.

The emergence of new liberalism can also be attributed to the changing social and economic conditions of the Victorian era. The Industrial Revolution brought about significant changes in society, leading to the rise of a new middle class and the growth of urbanization. This, in turn, led to a shift in the traditional understanding of liberalism, which focused on individual rights and limited government intervention. New liberalism, on the other hand, emphasized the role of the state in promoting social welfare and addressing the issues of poverty and inequality.
