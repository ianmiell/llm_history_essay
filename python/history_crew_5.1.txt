Liberalism is a political doctrine that emphasizes the protection of individual freedom. The role of the state in liberalism has evolved significantly from old liberalism to new liberalism during the Victorian era. While old liberalism saw government as a necessary protector of individual rights, new liberalism placed a greater emphasis on the state's role in promoting social justice and regulating the economy. This shift towards a more interventionist government was influenced by key figures such as Thomas Paine and John Maynard Keynes. As a result of this change, modern liberalism emerged as one of the two major political factions in the United States. The modern form of liberalism continues to prioritize individual freedom, but with a greater focus on government intervention in areas such as social justice and economic regulation. [0m

Final Answer: Based on my research and discussions with the Senior Historian, the key differences between old liberalism and new liberalism include a shift towards a more interventionist government, a greater focus on social justice, and an increased role of the state in regulating the economy. However, both forms of liberalism still prioritize the protection of individual freedom. Further areas of confusion I have found include the specific events or events that led to the emergence of new liberalism and the impact of key figures such as Thomas Paine and John Maynard Keynes on the development of these ideologies. I am also curious about the specific aspects of government regulation and social justice that were emphasized in new liberalism and how these differed from old liberalism. Additionally, I would like to gain a deeper understanding of how modern liberalism continues to manifest in contemporary politics and how it has evolved since its emergence in the Victorian era.[0m

The impact of the Industrial Revolution included: Many new machines were invented that could do things much faster than previously or could perform entirely new tasks. Steam power was cheaper, more reliable, and faster than more traditional power sources. The British Industrial Revolution (1760-1840) witnessed a great number of technical innovations, such as steam-powered machines, which resulted in new working practices, which in turn brought many social changes. One of the main impacts of the Industrial Revolution was the rise of factories and mass production. With the introduction of machines, goods could now be produced at a much faster rate and with less manual labor. This led to an increase in urbanization as people moved from rural areas to cities in search of employment in these new factories. The Industrial Revolution had a profound impact on society, fundamentally altering the way people lived, worked, and interacted with each other. Causes of the Industrial Revolution The causes of the Industrial Revolution were complex and multifaceted, resulting from a combination of economic, social, and technological factors. Industrial Revolution, in modern history, the process of change from an agrarian and handicraft economy to one dominated by industry and machine manufacturing. These technological changes introduced novel ways of working and living and fundamentally transformed society.
