Final Answer:
As can be seen from my search on the origins of new liberalism, this ideology has a complex history and development. It emerged in the early 20th century as a response to the decline of traditional liberalism and the rise of socialism. This new form of liberalism was known by a variety of names across the world, including Sozial-Liberalismus in German, New Liberalism in Britain, solidarisme in France, regeneracionismo in Spain, the Giolittian Era in Italy, and the Progressive Movement in the United States.

The roots of neoliberalism can be traced back to the mid-20th century and the work of economists such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman. They sought to revive the classical liberal tradition and argued for limited government intervention in the economy. Neoliberalism emphasizes the value of free market competition and sustained economic growth.

To further explore the origins and development of new liberalism, it's important to consider the impact of the Industrial Revolution on society and the class division it brought about. This transformation led to the breakdown of traditional social structures and the emergence of a middle class. This context set the stage for the emergence of new liberal ideas, which sought to address the social and economic issues brought on by industrialization.

Moving on to the impact of new liberalism on different countries, such as Germany and Italy, it's important to understand that each country had its own unique context and factors that influenced the implementation of new liberal policies. For example, in Germany, new liberalism was adopted alongside state interventionism, while in Italy, it was linked to the rise of fascism.

The ideas of Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman also played a significant role in the development of neoliberalism, which emerged as a response to the perceived failures of new liberalism. These economists promoted the idea of a free market economy with minimal government intervention, contrasting with the more interventionist policies of new liberals.
