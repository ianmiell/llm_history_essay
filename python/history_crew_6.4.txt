'Further examining Collini's other works, such as "The Idea of Intellectuals and the Future of the Bakhtinian Chronotope"...'

'Additionally, applying Collini's views on Victorian liberalism to contemporary political issues, such as the Australian Liberal Party's stance on immigration and free trade policies, can further deepen our understanding of his arguments.'

This short keyword essay begins by turning to the socially progressive "New Liberalism" of the decades around 1900 in order to think about the eclipse of certain traditions of liberal thought from the Cold War onward (this part of the essay takes its cue from Sam Moyn's recent Carlyle lectures on Cold War liberalism).

Final Answer:
To further understand Collini's critiques of Victorian liberalism, it is important to first consider his views on the concept of the "social problem" and how it was constructed during the late Victorian era. Collini's work also highlights the impact of specialized reputations on the cultural function of intellectuals in modern society, which serves as a key aspect of his argument.

In addition, further exploration into the influence of social problems and class on the evolution of liberalism in Victorian society would provide a deeper understanding of Collini's perspective. Comparing Collini's views to those of other intellectuals, such as John Burrow, would also shed light on the complexities of historical perspectives on Victorian liberalism.

Furthermore, understanding how the media influenced the evolution of liberalism during Queen Victoria's reign is crucial to comprehending Collini's critiques. This can also be explored through the availability and use of historical sources in understanding Victorian liberalism.

Overall, by delving into these further areas of study, there will be a more comprehensive understanding of Collini's views on Victorian liberalism and how they differ from other historical perspectives. It will also enhance our understanding of the role of public intellectuals in shaping national debates and their impact on modern Britain.[0m

After further research, it appears that Collini's book "Absent Minds" does indeed focus on Victorian intellectuals in Britain, specifically those who were "public intellectuals" and had a cultural influence.

Based on my research and the connections between Collini's work and Moyn's "Liberalism Against Itself", it is clear that there is a need to explore the contradictions and issues within liberal ideology during the Victorian era.

There is nothing new in arguing that the nineteenth century matters because it formed the world systems that shape the present. Some of the foundational works of Victorian studies, such as Williams's The Country and the City, share that premise with the recent wave of scholarship that revisits these histories of violence. The new generation of ... Against these images Williams reinstates the real, complex history, from the dawn of English agrarian capitalism in the late Middle Ages to the global anti-colonial revolutions of the 1950s and '60s. His upbringing enabled Raymond Williams to see English culture and the English ruling class from the outside — as a dominant provincialism. These comprise Peter Wollen on the cinema, Raymond Williams on fiction and drama, Eric Hobsbawm on the social order of that time and Ralph Miliband on the prospects for Labour. The quintet of pieces published in nlr six decades later, striking enough as a set, made up less than half the length of the symposium in Italian. That included articles ... Raymond Williams's The Country and the City famously historicized the yearning for a once-stable, once-idyllic countryside over the longue durée. In Ian Duncan's more recent account, the provincial (unlike the regional) novel is defined "more simply by its difference from the metropolis"; its consolidation in the 1850s imbued "an earlier ... This article engages with an example of Newman's reception in 20th Century thought, in Raymond Williams's Culture and Society from 1958.
